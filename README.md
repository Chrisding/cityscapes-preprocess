Cityscapes Dataset proprocessing code for **CASENet**

### License

The preprocessing code is released under the MIT License (refer to the LICENSE file for details).

### Introduction

The repository contains the preprocessing code of the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) for **CASENet**. CASENet is a recently proposed deep network with state of the art performance on category-aware semantic edge detection. For more information about CASENet, please refer to the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09759.pdf) and the paper published in [CVPR 2017](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Yu_CASENet_Deep_Category-Aware_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf).

### Usage
**Note:** In this part, we assume you are in the directory **`$CITYSCAPES_PREPROCESS_ROOT/`**

1. Create the folder **`data_orig/`**.

	```Shell
	mkdir data_orig
	```
2. Download the files "gtFine_trainvaltest.zip" and "leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip" from the Cityscapes website to **`data_orig/`**, and unzip them.

	```Shell
	unzip gtFine_trainvaltest.zip && rm gtFine_trainvaltest.zip
	unzip leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip && rm leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip
	```
2. Run the matlab code to preprocess the data.

	```Matlab
	# In Matlab Command Window
	run code/demo_preprocess.m
	```
    This will generate the .bin edge labels and the corresponding file lists that could be read by CASENet in **`data_gen/`**.
